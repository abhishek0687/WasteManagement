# WasteManagement

A nodeJs Waste Managment Project

To make the process of waste management easier & hassle free and bridge the Gap between the Waste generator and Recycler. As part of the Swatch Bharat Mission, we look forward to a clean & green INDIA. The current scenario is like - we don't care about the waste we generate, be it our daily domestic waste, or on a larger scale - the industrial waste, which we dump out haphazardly. This is in turn creating havoc, which definitely spells trouble.
